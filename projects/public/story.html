                           What I done over the years: <br /> <br />

                           On January 2022, I discovered Scratch, but did not actually join until June. I did not start coding until March, though. <br /> <br />

                           On March 2022, I started my first project in Scratch, remaking Geometry Dash. I also worked on a side project, called Marsh, for my friend. Marsh was a quick project, but I worked on it once every week, which explains why it was shared on June. Geometry Dash, though, took longer to make, taking up April, May, and June as well. I was working offline. <br /> <br />

                           On June 2022, I thought that Marsh was ready, so I joined Scratch to try and share it. This did not end up shared in my main account, instead, my friend shared it. It was still my project, and it was a collab. My Geometry Dash project failed, and I never shared it. It is just sitting in my account. So, I decided to remix another Geometry Dash recreation and change things up there. Before I remixed, I made a quick project called "The Scratch Cat" which would mark my first project in Scratch. Then I shared the remix. <br /> <br />

                           On July 2022, I did not share a lot in Scratch. Rather I did, but they were very bad that I ended up deleting them for good. I did get an idea for a project, and it would be a platformer with an editor. I really liked these types of projects, like Geometry Dash platformer mode, which was my favorite game (Geometry Dash 2.2 was not released to the public yet). I decided that since I can code, I would make this game, and call it Blocky (name from Cookiecreamx7). I started with the player, which looked like a Geometry Dash player, but I changed it a bit to look more original. I then spent all of July trying to make an editor to be able to place blocks in it. I sort of failed and succeeded. <br /> <br />

                           On August 2022, my game was ready for release. On the 8th, I released it. It did preform the best out of all my projects, getting 100 views. I was proud of this, and updated the game a bit to be better. I decided to make some other projects in Scratch, like some levels for a game called Appel, a game I really liked (one of my favorite in Scratch). I then decided to follow a tutorial from Griffpatch, and make a tile-scrolling platformer. While following, I noticed how the editor was very good, much better than my editor from Blocky. I realized that I failed making an editor and that my project as a whole was a failure. <br /> <br />

                           On September 2022, I had to do something about Blocky. This was not a game I wanted to make. The tile-scrolling tutorial made a game much better than this. I decided to redo Blocky entirely, starting a new project. I never updated the original Blocky ever again. Throughout the entire month I tried to make a working editor just like the one I saw from the tutorial. <br /> <br />

                           Once it was October 2022, I succeeded. Blocky had a functioning level editor, and making levels was way easier than the original game I made. I still needed to make a menu, and a storyline, so the game was far from done. I wanted to do something with this editor, so I made a level, and I made it multiplayer. I failed with the multiplayer, but at least the level worked. I continued with the game, working on the menu successfully, until my friend wanted to collab. We made Dotty's Adventure, which was only a 2 day work, using the new level editor that I learned to make. After this game was shared, not on my account though, I continued my work. <br /> <br />

                           On November 2022, I continued to work on Blocky throughout the entire month. My friend wanted to collab again, this time this game took the entire month. I made The Warrior, which was also a mini project, but it took longer to make than Dotty's Adventure. I made this once per week, and focused on Blocky. Blocky was being wrapped up at the end of this month, and I would fully finish The Warrior. I gave it to my friend who shared it, and it somehow got #1 on trending. I do not know how this happened to my friend, but my friend got so many followers, and became more popular than me. It was my project, and it was kind of unfair. <br /> <br />

                           On December 2022, Blocky was finished, and I was going to share it on the second week. Before I shared it, I explored an idea of random world generation, which I was planning to implement in Blocky in the future. The Warrior was on trending this entire month, and it got on the popular projects for half a year. On December 9, 2022, Blocky was shared. It got a few hundred views, but it was nowhere near as successful as The Warrior. On the same day, Dotty's Adventures got curated, which boosted the popularity of my friend even more. It was unfair. Yet again, after sharing Blocky, my friend wanted to collab again. I was working on The Survivor, which also was using a level editor like Blocky. It was basically the same thing like my other collabs, except with a few things changed. The Survivor was shared on December 24, and it did not blow up like The Warrior, it only got a thousand views. I did another collab, but this time I made a regular platformer, a winter themed one, and it was shared on December 25. Also, I decided to follow Griffpatch's tutorials, making a classic platformer I would have shared later. I made a 3D raycaster, and that was all I could make in 2022. <br /> <br />

                           The first week of January was full of activity. Every day I would follow a tutorial and share it on Scratch. This streak stopped after the RPG, which then I was done with all the tutorials. Later in the month, I would make a scrolling platformer engine which I would use if I ever made a scrolling platformer. Then, something that I would never expect to happen happened. Blocky got curated, which led it to getting thousands and thousands of views. This made Blocky my most popular project yet. <br /> <br />

                           On February 2023, I updated Blocky more, adding a clicker game to it. The thing I did not like about it was that no one made levels in it, and I thought I can add community made levels to the game. I added absolutely nothing. My game slowed down in its views. I also made a game for my sister, another platformer that was shared in early March. <br /> <br />

                           On March 2023, I decided to move away from Scratch and use Unity to make a game. I spent the entire first half of March making a clicker in Unity. I had itch.io after sharing a new version of Blocky that Scratch could not save. Itch.io was where I shared this game, and it did not get a ton of views. I realized that using Scratch made it much easier to get views on it than in itch.io. I uploaded an advertisement to the game on Scratch, but it did not get much views. This was as my game was not a WebGL game, and this was a problem with the build of this project. I fixed this, but it was too late. My project could not get any more views anymore. I decided to collab again, this time not making a platformer, but a game called Balloon Rise. In this game, the player, as a balloon, had to avoid obstacles in the x direction. It was a simple game that took up the rest of my time in March. <br /> <br />

                           On April 2023, I shared a quick project I made, a soundboard, as an April fools project. Not long after, I shared Balloon Rise, and this game got a few hundred views, but it did not hit trending. Also in April, I reached 100 followers, and I realized that to get my projects popular, I need a lot of followers. I had to do something to reach 500 followers faster. I decided to make a big project even bigger than Blocky that is a reward to all my 500 followers following me. I remembered the Geometry Dash project I failed to make at the start of my Scratch journey, so I decided to redo this project using my more advanced knowledge on a level editor. <br /> <br />

                           On May 2023, I spent my entire time working on this Geometry Dash level editor without working on another project. <br /> <br />

                           On June 2023, I continued to work on this project, but this was Summer break, a time where I do not need to focus on school and studies. I had more time. I had decided to put a break on this project and I decided to start a game series called the 1 sprite game series. I started with making a 1 sprite ultimate tic-tac-toe, and I tried to make it with a cloud system to connect with players using the cloud. I failed, and I decided to make another 1 sprite game which was the google chrome dino game in 1 sprite. <br /> <br />

                           On July 2023, Chrome Dino Game hit trending. I saw it on the second page, but I wanted it on first. I tried everything I can, adding it to more studios, but I failed. My project cannot make it to the first page like The Warrior, I got unlucky. Chrome Dino Game ended up getting only a thousand views. I made two more 1 sprite games, and both of them almost reached trending, but I failed. I failed my chances. After sharing a framework for my tile scrolling platformers I was using to help me with future games, I continued my work with Geometry Dash. <br /> <br />

                           On August 2023, I shared a platformer engine that I made for better platformers for the future. I reached 200 followers, and I saw that it was much quicker going from 100 to 200 followers than 0 to 100. I had to continue my project, otherwise, I might reach 500 followers before I finish. I continued my work, but also made an alt account back in scratch to share my test projects so I can separate these projects. I also decided that my alt account will have griffpatch's tutorials as I follow them. <br /> <br />

                           On September 2023, I continued work on my Geometry Dash project, while also following Griffpatch's tutorials in my alt account. This was the entire month. <br /> <br />

                           On October 2023, I continued like this, when something happened back in my main account. I reached 300 followers. I was slowly approaching 500 followers. I had to finish my project fast. It was almost done, though. <br /> <br />

                           The first part of November was when I finished my Geometry Dash. I am done, all I need is to share it on Scratch. I cannot do this as I do not have 500 followers yet. I can make more levels, but it is not mandatory, as this was a level editor I want the community to make levels. After getting done with this project, I had nothing planned to do in Scratch. I decided to make a website instead. On November 18, I had made my first webpage ever, which was very bad. Then I had decided to make a real website. After collecting games I found over the internet, I made a website with all these games. This was my first website, and I needed to find somewhere to host it. I thought I found a place, but it did not work. <br /> <br />

                           On December 2023, I found Github, where I can post websites. This time, it worked, and my website was live. I decided to update my website throughout this month. Once 2024 was nearing, I decided to make this website [projects], where I will share all my projects I made over the years and I will keep adding more projects in the future. <br /> <br />

                           On January 2024, I did not do much, I just tried to get 500 followers back on Scratch. On January 20, I decided to quickly make a home website for minecraftgoldfish3.github.io. On January 21, I got 400 followers on Scratch. This was very good, I was about to reach 500 followers. I also decided to experiement with Scratchattatch and see what I can do with this back on Scratch. <br /> <br />

                           On Feburary 2024, I had made a new game website, called Activities. I had not done much after this, I had just waited for 500 followers on Scratch. <br /> <br />

                           On March 2024, I still spent most of the month getting 500 followers. Later, though, I had decided to update my 'assets' repository with over 500 games. I had created another game website for all these 500 games, called Puzzlemath. Unblocked and Activities do not have as much games as this website, and they are also not cloaked. This game website will be cloaked for extra security. Since this has all the 500 games and security, it will probably be the last game website I would make, at least in the near future. After I finished making this, March was nearing an end, so I decided to spend my full time on Scratch. I am closer than ever to 500 followers, and I predicted that I will reach 500 followers at the beginning of April. I just want to release my Geometry Dash recreation, I want it out as soon as possible.<br /> <br />

                           On April 2024, finally, what I wanted to happen for months, I had reached 500 followers on Scratch, and that meant that I had to share my Geometry Dash project. It had done well, getting on trending, and getting over 100 loves and favorites, and the loves and favorites ratio as about the same. This was reallt good. It is my second most popular project. Later this month, I had decided to make yet another game website, and this time it was a collab. This website is called Illuminate and it is by far the best game website I had contributed to make in, better than Puzzlemath and Activities. This site is the project I am still working on, past April and into May. For real this time, I will not create more game sites, as this is the best one yet. Even my assets repository has a list of games, which is more than what Unblocked and Activities has. <br /> <br />
