        <h1>Editor Guide for <a href="../Geometry Dash.html">Geometry Dash Scratch</a>:</h1><hr />
        <p>To open the editor, click on the edit button to the right of the play button:</p>
        <img width="480" height="360" src="images/edit1.png" />
        <p>Once you click on it, click on the pause button on the left. After that, your screen should look like this:</p>
        <img width="480" height="360" src="images/edit2.png" />
        <h2>About the palette</h2><hr />
        <p>The palette at the bottom of the screen will hide when you move your mouse cursor away from it. It would show when you move the cursor towards the palette.</p><br />
        <p>You are currently at the 'build' section of the palette. The palette provides you with the blocks you would need to make a level. Each of the ten blocks are a category of blocks you can choose from. Keep clicking a category to change blocks until you get the block you want.</p><br />
        <p>If you have a keyboard, you can use the keys 0-9 to switch between categories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 - Blocks and decorative blocks.</li>
            <li>2 - More decorative blocks.</li>
            <li>3 - Deadly blocks.</li>
            <li>4 - Decorations.</li>
            <li>5 - Slopes.</li>
            <li>6 - This category does not exist yet.</li>
            <li>7 - Triggers.</li>
            <li>8 - Gameplay objects.</li>
            <li>9 - This category does not exist yet. (This is reserved for potential entities that may get added to this game).</li>
            <li>0 - Eraser.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Press the first category button (or the '1' key) to select the basic block.</p>
        <p>Place some of these blocks down.</p>
        <img width="480" height="360" src="images/edit3.png" />
        <p>This is how to get and place blocks. You can try cycling blocks in this first category, or place blocks from the other categories.</p>
        <p>There is a 'build' button in the top-left corner of the palette. You have currently selected this. Select the 'edit' button under the 'build' button.</p>
        <img width="480" height="360" src="images/edit4.png" />
        <p>There will be only one button called 'swipe.' This feature is only for mobile players. This button is for toggling building and moving.</p><br />
        <p>If you have a keyboard, use WASD or the arrow keys to move.</p><br />
        <p>On mobile, click this button, and it will turn blue. You then can hold on the screen to move around. To disable this, click on this button again.</p>
        <p>The button under the 'edit' button is the delete button. Click on this.</p>
        <img width="480" height="360" src="images/edit5.png" />
        <p>Now your brush is going to be the eraser. You can use this mode to easily delete other objects.</p>
        <h3>Other hotkeys for the editor:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>e - This key is the eyedropper. Hover over a block and click this key to automatically select this block.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If you hover over an empty tile, the eyedropper will select the eraser.</p><br />
        <h2>Playtesting the level</h2><hr />
        <p>You can playtest the level by clicking the playtest button (the button under the music button).</p>
        <p>By clicking this button, all other buttons will disappear, and the playtest button will turn into a pause button.</p>
        <img width="480" height="360" src="images/edit10.png" />
        <p>You will be playing the level. <a href="gameplay.html">Learn about gameplay here.</a></p>
        <h2>Other buttons</h2><hr />
        <p>This editor has a lot of buttons. Refer to this image for all these buttons.</p>
        <img width="480" height="360" src="images/edit2.png" />
        <h3>Undo button:</h3>
        <p>This button is at the top-left corner of the game. This button undoes the last action you done.</p>
        <h3>Redo button:</h3>
        <p>Right next to the undo button, this button undoes what you have undoed with the undo button.</p>
        <h3>Delete button:</h3>
        <p>Next to the redo button, this button deletes your last action of placing a block.</p>
        <h3>Music button:</h3>
        <p>Under the undo button, the music button plays the song you have selected for the level.</p>
        <h3>Playtest button:</h3>
        <p>Refer to the playtest section for this button.</p><br />
        <p>Now it is time for the buttons on the right of your screen.</p><br />
        <h3>Copy button:</h3>
        <p>This button saves your current brush you have selected.</p>
        <h3>Paste button:</h3>
        <p>This button changes your brush to the saved brush you have copied.</p>
        <h3>Copy + Paste button:</h3>
        <p>This button acts as an eyedropper for mobile. Once you select this, you would have to click on the object for your brush.</p>
        <h3>Edit Special button:</h3>
        <p>This has no current use. It is reserved for special objects and entities.</p>
        <h3>Edit Group button:</h3>
        <p>Refer to the trigger section to use this button.</p>
        <h3>Edit Object button:</h3>
        <p>This button opens this menu:</p>
        <img width="480" height="360" src="images/edit6.png" />
        <p>Each of these sliders changes a property of the brush.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dir - changes the direction of an object.</li>
            <li>Scale - changes the size of an object. <b>Note:</b> this does not change the hitbox of the object, and is mainly used for decorative objects.</li>
            <li>Color - changes the hue of an object.</li>
            <li>Bright - changes the brightness of an object.</li>
            <li>Ghost - changes the opacity of an object.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note:</b> there is no saturation of an object because in Scratch, there is no way of changing the saturation. This project was started in Scratch and moved to Turbowarp, so adding saturation is too late.</p>
        <h3>Copy Values button:</h3>
        <p>Copies the properties of an object; it copies the properties above along with the group id of the object.</p>
        <h3>Paste State button:</h3>
        <p>Pastes a group id to an object.</p>
        <h3>Paste Color button:</h3>
        <p>Pastes the color, brightness, and opacity to an object.</p>
        <h3>Set End button:</h3>
        <p>In each level, there is an end to it. Its default value is 2325 blocks, which is the maximum length of a level. You can use this to set the end of the level. Type in 'k' to set the end of the level to your current position.</p>
        <p>The keyboard shortcut to setting an end is to press 'k.'</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> there is another way of setting the end of a level. This is done by placing an end trigger, which is discussed in the triggers section.</p>
        <h3>Go to Layer button:</h3>
        <p>In each level, there are three layers. Each layer allows one object per grid space to be placed. Multiple layers allow for stacking to happen per grid space.</p>
        <p>Blocks from another layer will be faded. The current layer blocks will be solid.</p>
        <p>This button cycles through each of the three layers.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> layers are not optimized the best way, and the rendering of layers are responsible for the lag that is being caused. There are over 600 clones being rendered. If you have a fix to this problem and can optimize the lag while still rendering all layers, make sure to comment in the project back on scratch.</p>
        <h3>Deselect button:</h3>
        <p>This button changes the brush to an eraser.</p>
        <h2>Settings</h2><hr />
        <p>This button has options that you can change.</p>
        <img width="480" height="360" src="images/edit8.png" />
        <p>The 'bg' option changes the background.</p>
        <p>The 'grnd' option changes the ground.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> there are two triggers that have not yet been added to the game: the background and ground trigger. These triggers change the background and ground. These are planned to be added.</p>
        <p>The 'song' option changes the song of the level.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> the songs are only main level songs. I have been trying to find a way to embed songs directly from newgrounds, but newgrounds does not allow this. If you know of a song library that is embeddable, comment back in scratch.</p>
        <p>The 'two player' checkbox toggles on two player mode. Go to the <a href="gameplay.html">gameplay</a> section and find the dual section to learn about this mode.</p>
        <p>The 'platformer' checkbox toggles on platformer mode. In this mode, you are free to move in a platformer style rather than just go forward. <a href="gameplay.html">Go to the gameplay section to learn more about this mode.</a></p>
        <h2>Pause menu</h2><hr />
        <p>Click on the pause button in the top-right corner to go to the pause menu.</p>
        <img width="480" height="360" src="images/edit9.png" />
        <p>The 'save' button saves your level by downloading a file. The level code is also automatically copied to your clipboard.</p>
        <p>To share this save code, go to the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/736117/" target="_blank">discussion forum</a> and paste your code there.</p>
        <p>The 'load' button loads your level. Paste your level code in the text box.</p>
        <p>The 'reset' button resets the level.</p>
        <p>The 'save and exit' button saves your level and exits the level editor.</p>
        <p>The 'exit' button exits the level editor <u>without saving the level.</u></p>
