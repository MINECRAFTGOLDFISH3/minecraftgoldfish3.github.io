            <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are a kind of short term memory for the web. They are stored in your browser and enable a site to ‘remember’ little bits of information between pages or visits.</p>
            <h2>How does this site use cookies?</h2>
            <p>This site uses cookies to store save data from the games you play, that way you can come right back to the game and continue where you left off, unless you refresh your search history (hmm why would you do that?) all of the data should save.</p>
