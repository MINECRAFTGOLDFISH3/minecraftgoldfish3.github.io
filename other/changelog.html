            <h1>Changelog</h1>
            <p>This is the new updates page, now I will write everything that was changed on the site. Make sure to check this webpage to see if your request was added, if you had requested anything.</p>
            <p><b>10/2/2024:</b> Added game domain switching from Illuminate just in case the default game domain is blocked.</p>
            <p><b>9/29/2024:</b> Using past github commits, I was able to write down everything I changed on this site ever since I made my github account back in December, so take a look by scrolling down. Also added a bunch of tools, including an about:blank embedder, browser info, number generator, password generator, qr code generator, redirect generator, and a timer. Created a page to store all these tools.</p>
